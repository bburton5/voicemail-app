# voicemail-app

## I originally created this app locally on my device with multiple buttons that had audio files hardcoded into them to play a certain voice recording that would be left as a voice message when I worked at a Private Clinic as we would leave the same voice message to multiple patients a day. In order to minimize the effort and time put into leaving the voice messages, I created this app. This newer version of the app is supposed to be interactive where you can upload and remove new sounds to buttons.
